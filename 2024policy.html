    <h2 class="wf_centered" style="padding-top:15px;">Music Together Learn and Grow 2024 Policies</h2>


    <div style="padding-top:10px"><p>Please read this prior to your first class and be sure to share with any other adults who will be attending class with your child. 
<br><br>

 <h2 class="wf_centered" style="padding-top:15px;">Masks and Physical Distancing </h2><br><br>



Masking is optional. We reserve the right to add masking requirements at any point during the session in cases of government mandates or safety concerns.
<br><br>
Please be respectful of any families who wish to maintain Social Distance.
<br><br>

</p>


 <h2 class="wf_centered" style="padding-top:15px;"> Vaccinations </h2>


    <div style="padding-top:10px"><p>At this point in time we are requesting that only vaccinated adults accompany students to our indoor classes. We reserve the right to request proof of vaccination for any non-student attendees.<br><br>


<h2 class="wf_centered" style="padding-top:15px;">Plan for Instruments/Props</h2><br><br>
Your instructor will provide Props/Instruments for class.  If you prefer you are welcome to bring your own props/instruments to class for your personal use.  Objects that have been mouthed or have encountered mucus or saliva by other means should be placed in the “wet” or “dirty” bin when props/instruments are put away.  Objects in the wet/dirty bin will be sanitized at the end of each class.<br><br> </p>

 <h2 class="wf_centered" style="padding-top:15px;"> Illness and Makeup Policy for Summer 2022 </h2>


    <div style="padding-top:10px"><p>COVID-19 is an extremely contagious disease that can lead to severe illness and death. By attending classes in person you voluntarily assume all risks related to exposure to COVID-19.
<br><br>
If you or anyone in your household has any symptoms of COVID (fever, cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, new loss of smell or taste), please stay home. If your unvaccinated student has had close contact with others in the last 5 days who have, the COVID-19 virus, please stay home. Regardless of vaccination status please watch for symptoms and test between days 5 and 7 from most recent exposure.
<br><br>
If you or your child has had a fever, you must be fever-free for at least 24 hours (without assistance of fever-reducing medication) before returning to class. 
<br><br>
Make-up classes can be done in the other weekly class, space permitting, please email Donna to confirm the availability of a make-up class.  Make-up classes are not guaranteed. Make-up classes must be completed in the same session and do not roll over into future sessions.  You may make up a class in advance of the absence, if your absence is planned.


</p>

 <h2 class="wf_centered" style="padding-top:15px;"> COVID-19 Reporting Policy</h2>


    <div style="padding-top:10px"><p>If someone in your household tests positive for COVID-19 or is exposed to someone who has tested positive, please let us know right away. We will follow the contact tracing protocol set by the Somerset County Department of Health, which includes notifying families in the same class of the possible exposure, and quarantine as needed. Names will not be disclosed.
</p>

 <h2 class="wf_centered" style="padding-top:15px;"> Siblings</h2>

If you have an older child who is off school and you wish to bring them along to class, don't hesitate to get in touch with us for permission to attend. Siblings under 5 who are coming regularly need to be registered.

</p>

 <h2 class="wf_centered" style="padding-top:15px;">Photos & Phone Usage</h2>

Barring an emergency, please put your phone away during class, we’d like you to be present and in the moment to make music with your child.  We understand the desire to take photos in class please keep it to a minimum.  Please do not post any photos containing individuals outside your family unit without obtaining permission.
</p>


 <h2 class="wf_centered" style="padding-top:15px;">Class Cancelation Policy</h2>


    <div style="padding-top:10px"><p>If a class is canceled due to weather or any other reason, we reserve the right to provide the makeup class either online, pre-recorded, or at a later date.
<br><br>
We reserve the right to switch to virtual classes at any point during the session in cases of government mandates or safety concerns.
<br><br>
Refunds/credits will not be given for missed classes unless there is an exceptional circumstance. If it’s impossible for you to attend for the rest of the session, notify us immediately so another child can take your spot. 
<br><br>
Please reach out to Donna Lewin (she/her/hers), Director, at any time with any questions or concerns about these policies. donna@mtlearnandgrow.com
