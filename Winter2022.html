    <h2 class="wf_centered" style="padding-top:15px;">Winter Session 2022 Policies</h2>


    <div style="padding-top:10px"><p>Please read this prior to your first class and be sure to share with any other adults who will be attending class with your child. 
<br><br>
Our policies have been informed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Department of Health and are subject to change. An inherent risk of exposure to COVID-19 exists in any public place where people are present. COVID-19 is an extremely contagious disease that can lead to severe illness and death. By attending classes in person you voluntarily assume all risks related to exposure to COVID-19.
<br><br>
We take the health risks of Covid-19 seriously and need your cooperation to mitigate the risks to all participants. Our teachers reserve the right to send a family home from class if they feel the protocols are not being followed.
<br><br>
</p>

 <h2 class="wf_centered" style="padding-top:15px;">Indoor Classes: Masks and Physical Distancing </h2><br><br>



We will pre-mark a spot for each family, to maintain distance between family groups. Wear a face mask securely covering your mouth and nose when you are closer than 6 feet from other families/teacher.  While on your marked spot or otherwise distanced, you may remove your masks at your own discretion.   <br><br>
Children will naturally wander and forcing them to stay put can be counterproductive. However we want to prevent close face-to-face contact between persons of different households. If your child gets too close to a sitting family/ teacher, please redirect them unless you have permission from that family for your child to approach. Small children near standing/dancing adults for a brief period of time should be low risk and it should not be necessary to redirect them.</p>


 <h2 class="wf_centered" style="padding-top:15px;"> Vaccinations </h2>


    <div style="padding-top:10px"><p>At this point in time we are requesting that only vaccinated adults accompany students to our indoor classes. We reserve the right to request proof of vaccination for any non-student attendees.<br><br>


<h2 class="wf_centered" style="padding-top:15px;">Plan for Instruments/Props</h2><br><br>
The latest information on COVID transmission states that COVID is airborne and that transmission from surfaces is rare. However, due to the quick turnaround time between classes, we as asking families to bring their own instruments to class. Your instructor will provide additional information after registration.<br><br> </p>

 <h2 class="wf_centered" style="padding-top:15px;"> Illness and Makeup Policy for Winter 2022 </h2>


    <div style="padding-top:10px"><p>If you or anyone in your household has any symptoms of COVID (fever, cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, new loss of smell or taste), please stay home. If your unvaccinated student has had close contact with others in the last 2 weeks who have, or suspect that they may have the COVID-19 virus, please stay home.  <br><br>
If you or your child has had a fever, you must be fever-free for at least 24 hours (without assistance of fever-reducing medication) before returning to class.  <br><br>
In Person registrants may make up missed classes in our Virtual Classroom at any time during the semester. If you cannot attend virtual classes, you may use the pre-recorded videos available on Facebook as make-up classes.
<br><br>
Virtual registrants may use the pre-recorded videos on Facebook as make-up classes.  </p>

</p>

 <h2 class="wf_centered" style="padding-top:15px;"> COVID-19 Reporting Policy</h2>


    <div style="padding-top:10px"><p>If someone in your household tests positive for COVID-19 or is exposed to someone who has tested positive, please let us know right away. We will follow the contact tracing protocol set by the Somerset County Department of Health, which includes notifying families in the same class of the possible exposure, and quarantine as needed. Names will not be disclosed.</p>

 <h2 class="wf_centered" style="padding-top:15px;">Class Cancelation Policy</h2>


    <div style="padding-top:10px"><p>If a class is canceled due to weather or any other reason, we reserve the right to provide the makeup class either online, pre-recorded, or in-person outside at a later date. <br><br>
We reserve the right to switch to virtual classes at any point during the session in cases of government mandates or safety concerns. <br><br>
Refunds/credits will not be given for missed classes unless there is an exceptional circumstance. If it’s impossible for you to attend for the rest of the session, notify us immediately so another child can take your spot.  <br><br>
Please reach out to Donna Lewin, Director, at any time with any questions or concerns about these policies. donna@mtlearnandgrow.com</p>
